Explain javac and java
- javac: javac is command which is used to compile the program and it will convert source code to byte code
  java: java is command which is used to run the program and it will convert byte code to machine code

2. Explain JDK,JRE,JVM
- JDK-Java Development Kit. JDK is combination of JRE and development tools. development tools are doc, javac etc
  JRE-Java Run time Environment. JRE is combination of JVM and set of libraries
  JVM-Java Virtual Machine. JVM is having 4 components
      1.byte code load
      2.verifie byte code
      3.interpreter
      4.provide runtime environment
 JDK is minimum requirement to compile program
 JRE is minimum requirement to run the java program with the help of JVM
JDK,JRE,JVE all are platform dependent
JDK,JRE are physically exist but JVM is not physically exit

3.List the limitation of array
- similar type of data are used
  provide size of array

4.Explain class,object and signature of class
- class: It is the template which is having states and behaviours of class
  object: Instance of class
  main purpose of class is to create multiple copies of class
  Signature: Class referenceVariable=new Class();


5.Difference between .java file and .class file
       .java file                  .class file
1. It is the source code          1. It is the byte code
2.These files given to javac to   2.these files are given to java to 
  compile                           run

6.Explain method signature
 Signature: access modifier returntypes methodName(parameters){
//block of statements
}
access modifier:public static
return types:void,boolean, string etc
methodName:name given to method as per users requirement with or without parameters

7.What is java
- java is high level object oriented programming language

8.What is java IDE
- It is the tool which is used to write or edit the java program

9.What is variable and explain it's types
-Variable: Variable is the container which is used to store the data or value
 There are 4 types
 local static instance parameter
local-these variables declare inside method and class
static-these variables declare outside method but inside class
instance-these are same as static but without static keyword
parameter-these are used in method

10.list the java keywords
public, static, void, int,boolean,long,double,char,short,float,this,import,super

11.what is class variables
 class variables are the static and instance variables which are declare inside class but outside method

12.What is datatypes and types
- datatype is the representation of variables
there are 2 types primitive and non primitive
there are 8 primitive data types
there are 2 non primitive data types

13.what is dot operator
- dot operators are used to invoke parameters

14.list the java features
-It is simple
 It is secured
 It is platform Independent
 It is open source

15. what is the base class of all the class
-main class

16. what is method overloadind with example
 method overloading is the process in which class having multiple methods having same name but different in parameters

example
Class Addition{

public static void main( String a[]){
add(4,5);
add(10,3,7);
}

public static void add(int a,int b){
int addition=a+b;
System.out.println("addition of numbers "+ addition);

}

public static void add(int s,int h, int j){
int addition1=s+h+j;
System.out.println("addition of numbers "+ addition1);
}
}
